# CODIND PROJECTS
# 1st Project - K-means algorithm
K-means algorithm is well known "unsopervised ML" algorithem.
The input is a text file with N vectors in length M (each cordinate is a number).
Each vector represent some data (s.a. age, height, weight ...)
We want to cluster all the data to K clusters.
The output is the centroids of the K clusters.
When we get a new vector (for example, a new user in our app) we can classified it to the right cluster.

# 2nd Project - Simon Game
Implementing Simon game functionality using JavaScript and Jquery. 

# 3rd Project - Spectral Clustering

# 4th Project - To Do List
